# AI Coding Instructions

## Architecture Overview

This is a tui application for extracting common colors from an image and generating themes with it.

### Key Technical Patterns
- **Zig Language**: The entire application is written in Zig 0.15.2, leveraging its performance and safety features.
- **Image Processing**: Uses `zigimg` library for image loading and pixel manipulation.
- **Color Theory**: Implements color distance calculations and contrast adjustments for better theme generation.
- **Tui Interface**: Uses `libvaxis` library for terminal-based user interface.


### Some Rules to Follow
- Check if the code is compiling and running correctly after making changes.
- Follow the zig 0.15.2 syntax and best practices.
- Don't create .md files unless specifically asked.
- Dont over comment the code. Only add comments where necessary for clarity.
